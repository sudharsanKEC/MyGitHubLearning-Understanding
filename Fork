    As like branch, fork is something similar to branch

    In branching, we create a branch for the main or master within the repo for some enhancing or experimenting with the
existing code without affecting the existing code.

    But in this fork, if a repo is public, and if another user found it from the github , if he want the same source
code or his project or if he suggests to improve our existing code he can modify our source code within his workspace
which wont affect our branch at any time.
  After that he may sent a pull request to merge it with our code, we may merge it according to our wish


Fork:
    When a community wants to contribute to our repository, they dont have direct permission to edit it,
instead they can fork it and make changes according to their idea and suggest the owner to merge it by sending a 
pull request.
    The original author of the repository can verify the pull request and accept or decline the pull request.


    After adding the above definition I am going to send a pull request to merge to my main account's main branch
and there I will accept the pull request.



    Now I have accepted the pull request and merged it with my main branch.
