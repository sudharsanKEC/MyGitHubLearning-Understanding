Branch : 
    Imagine this scenario where your code runs well and good(main or master), but you have thought to improve it further,
but you are worrying about that may create a problem in the existing performance of the code, so you feel, you dont 
want to change the existing code instead you can create a branch repo for the existing repo and there you can able to made your
further changes for your code, which will dont affect the original good code.
    After a while, you have found that the branch code is working well then you can able to merge it with the
previuos existing code by sending a pull request.

In some professional words:
    A branch  is to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
    Each repository has its own one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using 
a pull request.

Benefits of branches:
    1)Develop features
    2)Fix bugs
    3)Safely experiment with new ideas
