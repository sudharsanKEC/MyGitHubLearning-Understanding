Working with Git terminal

We are going to create some files and add it to the remote repo (github.com) using terminal

Software Needed:
----------------
Any text editor - I am using visual studio code

------------------

Installed git for 64 bit windows from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
After completing the installation process opened git bash.

Difference between git bash and git cmd

Git bash - look and feel like linux
Git CMD - looks like windows terminal
